# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Announces Industry Accelerators

Dynamics 365 announced the Microsoft Power Platform, a connected app platform 
that unifies access to your data to enable ISVs, SIs, Partners and Customers to build intelligent, 
data driven, task focused business and analytic applications. Microsoft is focused on enabling a data 
culture where the Microsoft Power Platform acts as the glue across Dynamics 365 (CE, F&O, Talent), 
Office 365 (SharePoint, Teams), Power BI, Power Apps, Microsoft Flow, Azure and other 3rd party on-premise 
and cloud based solutions.

# Introducing

With the Power Platform providing a unified approach to building data driven solutions, the team is taking 
it one step further by introducing Industry Solution Accelerators. Accelerators are industry focused foundational 
components that enable ISVs and other solution providers, a way to build solutions that are based on industry 
standards supported and driven by Microsoft. Along with our Health Accelerator that was released during Inspire 2018, 
which you can read about here, we are focused on delivering accelerators for the following industries (but not limited too):

Automotive (Manufacturing)
EDU (Higher Ed / K-12)
Retail
Financial Services (Credit Union, Banking, Wealth Management)
Not for Profit
Health
And others

Industry Solution Accelerators enable you to build solutions on the Microsoft Power Platform that connect to your 
existing 3rd party applications, embed new applications on Dynamics 365 and extend existing first party application, 
such as Sales, Service and Marketing. Resources have been allocated across Microsoft Product Groups, Field, Sales, Marketing, 
OCP and Industry Vertical Teams to identify Partners, SI’s, ISVs and Customers to partner with Microsoft to shape and deliver 
solutions on top of our accelerators.
