The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Banking Accelerator provides a new Banking data model and samples allowing you to easily build apps, processes, analytics, and gain new insights. The Banking data model extends the Microsoft Common Data Model for loan, mortgage, referrals, branch, collateral, deal, limit, facilities, and more. The model provides a shared and consistent metadata definition for common banking entities allowing customers and ISVs to build on the same data model, this common schema allows for new interoperability and improved processes and insights.

If you are interested in participating in the private preview of the Banking Accelerator, a sign up is available at https://aka.ms/CDMEngage. Weâ€™re looking for both feedback and active collaboration as we evolve the current version of the banking model.
